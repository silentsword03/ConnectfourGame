# ConnectfourGame
Connect Four is a two-player connection board game in which players take turns and place a colored disc into a playing field consisting of typically 6 rows and 7 colums. The game is not flat on a table but standing upright. The disc falls down to the lowest row within a column where there was still an empty place.
Your tasks are
Write an algorithm that checks the winning condition for the given board states.
Write a function that creates a valid random move for a given player. Think about gravity!
Plays 5 random matches with two computer players and reports back the final board state.
Phase 1 - Timeboxed: Time limit: 1 hour

Phase 2 - Finishing touches: No strict time limit (i.e. couple of hours)

Solution
The workable solution has to be an export of the Jupyter notebook. Please make sure that the code works when starting with a fresh Python Kernel and selecting Run All. Please submit your solution via e-mail and add your name to the filename.

Hints
You may lookup part of the code but please be aware that the time limit may not allow a proper integration. Please cite your sources.
Have a look at your solution and make sure that the given output actually shows a working solution in action.
Is the game realy random? Or are the moves always the same? The random function might need initialization.
Grading
The focus is on the output of 5 random games. It may differ from the given examples.
When it is your own code, we grade also on partial solutions.
Writing Pythonic code is a plus.
Applying developer best practices is a plus.
Writing some documentation and about your thoughts is a plus.
Simple solutions are valid to pass the challenge.
Sophisticated algorithms are a plus.
Implementing an "AI" that tries to win is a plus.
